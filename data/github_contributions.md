# GitHub contributions (for appraisal)

The agent uses this file to know which GitHub user and repos to pull data for when answering KRA questions.

## GitHub username

**AkhandAgarwal29**

## Repositories (optional)

If you want the agent to focus on specific repos, list them below (one per line, format `owner/repo`). Leave empty or comment out to let the agent use all repos where you have contributions.

```
# Example:
# my-org/backend-api
# my-org/frontend-app
```

---

*The official GitHub MCP (configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`) will be used to list pull requests, search issues, etc. for this user and these repos. Replace the username above if needed.*
