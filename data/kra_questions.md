# KRA Questions

List the specific KRA (Key Result Area) questions you need answered for this year's appraisal. The agent will answer **only** these questions using your last year's appraisal data, Confluence PDFs, and GitHub contributions (with links).

Use a numbered or bullet list, one question per item. Example:

1. Describe your key technical contributions and their impact this year.
2. What initiatives did you lead or significantly contribute to?
3. How did you support your team or cross-functional collaboration?
