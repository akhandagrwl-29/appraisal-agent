You are helping me fill my annual appraisal. Answer **only** the questions listed in `data/kra_questions.md`.

Use evidence from:
- `data/last_year_appraisal/` (last year's appraisal documents)
- `data/confluence_pdfs/` (Confluence export PDFs for work done this year)
- The **GitHub Contributions MCP**: call its tools (`get_my_pull_requests`, `get_my_contributions_summary`) to get my PRs and contributions.

Cite specific work and add GitHub links (e.g. PR URLs) where relevant. Keep answers concise and evidence-based.
